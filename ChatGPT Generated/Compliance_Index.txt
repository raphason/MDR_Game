Compliance Index (CI) System
----------------------------
- Ranges from -5 (Autonomy) to +5 (Loyalty).
- Affects narrative, gameplay rules, item availability, and endgame outcome.

Influence Sources:
- Tools: Company Tools increase Loyalty.
- Contraband: Black market items increase Autonomy.
- Dialogue: Responses during Break Room scenes influence CI.
- Actions: Refusing tools, skipping upgrades, or avoiding corporate bonuses affect CI.

Threshold Effects:
+5 Loyalty: Bin groupings may be up to 6 numbers, lower token cost.
-5 Autonomy: Secret Bin unlocked, access to Obscurity Temper.
+3 Loyalty: Access to exclusive Tool sets (e.g., “Senior Refiner’s Stylus”)
-3 Autonomy: Contraband shop opens (e.g., “Greed Extractor” – tripled Token yield, no scoring)

Endings:
+5 Loyalty → Promotion Ending
-5 Autonomy → Reintegration Ending
Other values influence Break Room flavor and Codex entries.
