Macrodata Refinement - Game Design Document (Draft)
---------------------------------------------------

Core Gameplay Loop:
- Grid (7x6) of single-digit numbers.
- Player selects adjacent groupings (3â€“5 numbers) attempting to match hidden Temper rules.
- Groupings score points if they match a rule.
- Four Tempers per bin; all meters must be filled to complete a bin.
- Limited number of groupings per bin (e.g., 10); running out = fail.
- Completing a bin resets groupings and increases difficulty.

Scoring & Economy:
- Score = sum of valid numbers in a group.
- Earn Tokens based on success.
- Tokens spent in Break Room Vending Machine for Tools, Vouchers, Contraband.
- Tokens do not persist between runs.

Compliance Index (CI):
- Scale from Loyalty to Autonomy.
- Company items push Loyalty, Contraband pushes Autonomy.
- Affects available items, dialogue, and endings.
- High Loyalty: Promotion Ending.
- High Autonomy: Reintegration Ending.

Break Room:
- Dialogue affects CI.
- Vending Machine purchase phase.
- Music Dance Experience triggers at 75% (Bin 4 complete), adds random modifier.

Secret Fifth Bin:
- Requires specific CI or Contraband.
- Introduces negative numbers, 0s, redacted values (*).
- Adds 5th hidden Temper: Obscurity.
- Rewards permanent cosmetics or unlocks.

Codex:
- Builds over runs with discovered rules, item effects, MDE outcomes.
- Unlocks new Refiners and lore.

Refiners:
- Start with Mark S., Helly R., Dylan G., Irving B.
