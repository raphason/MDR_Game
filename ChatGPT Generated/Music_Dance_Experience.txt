Music Dance Experience (MDE)
----------------------------
- Triggered at 75% File Completion (after 4 bins).
- Player selects from a randomized set of 4 genres (from 16 total).
- Each provides a buff or modifier through the final bins.

Examples:
- Reckless Disco: +3 extra groupings, Autonomy +2
- Defiant Jazz: All Temper scores fill 20% at start of Bin 5
- Lofty Orchestra: All Temper scoring is increased by 1.5x
- Spooky Ambient: Grid reshuffles every 2 turns
- Tearful Emo: All Tokens earned are doubled but CI shifts toward Autonomy

Mood, lighting, and music track change accordingly for dramatic gameplay tone shift.
