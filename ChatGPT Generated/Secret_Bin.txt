Secret Fifth Bin & Obscurity Temper
-----------------------------------
- Unlocked only when:
    - CI reaches +5 or -5
    - Or specific Break Room dialogue options are chosen
- Obscurity Temper Rule: Varies each run (e.g., alternating parity, reverse primes, etc.)
- New types of grid entries:
    - Negative Numbers (e.g., -3, -7)
    - Zero (acts as wildcard or null)
    - Redacted Digits (*) – Unknown value

Challenges:
- Temper Tools behave differently (some fail entirely).
- Grid partially hidden or locked.
- Some tools become corrupted or unavailable.

Rewards:
- Permanent desk cosmetics
- Unlocked Refiner variant
- Access to hidden Codex pages
- Special outro/endings (e.g., “Severed Consciousness”)

Scoring here counts double for Tokens, but failures are also more punishing.
