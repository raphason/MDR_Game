Temper System Overview
----------------------
- Groupings must be 3â€“5 adjacent single-digit numbers.
- Each grouping is evaluated against hidden rules that correspond to one of the Four Tempers:
    1. Woe
    2. Dread
    3. Frolic
    4. Malice

- Example Temper Rule Ideas:
    - Woe: All even numbers
    - Dread: All prime numbers
    - Frolic: Increasing sequence (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
    - Malice: All identical numbers

- A correct grouping adds the sum of the group to that Temper's meter.
- Each bin requires filling all four Tempers to complete.
- Temper rules are not known to the player initially but are recorded in the Codex once discovered.
